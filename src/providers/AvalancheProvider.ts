/**

 * keyless, confirmed live: GET /v2/public/products/map-layer returns a
 * GeoJSON FeatureCollection of US/Alaska forecast-center regions, one
 * polygon per center, with that center's current overall danger rating.
 * Confirmed via a direct test call (2026-08-24): 83 forecast centers, every
 * one currently "off_season"/"no rating" since it's currently avalanche
 * off-season in the US — that off-season state is real data, not a bug, and
 * the UI must show it honestly rather than treating a quiet season as an
 * error.
 *
 * Coverage: continental US + Alaska only. This is a known, documented
 * limitation — there is no single free/keyless global avalanche API. Other
 * countries' national avalanche warning services could be added later
 * behind this same interface (see AvalancheProvider) once a specific one is
 * verified and its terms confirmed.
 *
 * This endpoint mirrors the one avalanche.org's own public map uses; its
 * written terms of use were not independently reviewed line-by-line here,
 * so treat this as "publicly observed live usage", not a confirmed license
 * grant — worth a proper terms check before any commercial/high-volume use.
